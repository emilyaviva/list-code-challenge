## Web Development List Code Challenge

This app displays a list of strings as options in a `<select>` dropdown menu. The strings are passed as props to the `App` component. When a string is selected and a button is clicked, an unordered list item containing the selected string is added to a results area with a delete button. Clicking the delete button deletes all instances of the string from the results.

This app was scaffolded with [create-react-app](facebook/create-react-app).

### Building the app
